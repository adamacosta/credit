This package contains one dataset:

`crx`

### Data Set Information:

This file concerns credit card applications. All attribute names and values have been 
changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality of the data. 

This dataset is interesting because there is a good mix of attributes -- 
continuous, nominal with small numbers of values, and nominal with larger numbers 
of values. There are also a few missing values.
